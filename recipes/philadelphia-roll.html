        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>A <strong>Philadelphia roll</strong> is a makizushi a type of sushi generally made with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and avocado, with rice on the outside. It is sometimes made with imitation crab instead of salmon, but can be found to include other ingredients, such as other types of fish, cucumber, scallions, and sesame seed. Like many Western inspired sushi rolls, its design and name are modified to target an American market, which includes putting the rice on the outside, and the nori in the inside to appeal to western aesthetics.</p>
